# Unix Shell
Done by me and my partner EJ Lilagan

This project consists of designing a C/C++ program to serve as a shell interface that accepts user commands and then executes each command in a seperate process. 

## Features 
1. Executing a command in a child process
2. History
3. Redirecting input and output
4. Communication via a pipe



## Compilation
- Compile: `make`
- Execution: `./prog2`
